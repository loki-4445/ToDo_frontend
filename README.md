```markdown
# ToDo Website ✅

A feature-rich ToDo application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) to manage tasks efficiently.

## Features ✨
- **Add Tasks**: Add tasks dynamically with real-time updates.
- **Task Management**: Users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks.
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized for all devices with a clean and intuitive interface.
- **Backend Integration**: Data is stored in a MongoDB database for persistence.

## Live Demo 🌐
Check out the live site here: [ToDo Website](https://todobylokesh.netlify.app/)

## Technologies Used 🛠️

### Frontend:
- **React.js**: For building a dynamic and responsive UI.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: For the server-side runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: For creating the RESTful API.

### Database:
- **MongoDB**: To store tasks persistently.

### Hosting:
- **Frontend**: Deployed on Netlify.
- **Backend**: Deployed on a cloud service (e.g., Heroku, Render, or AWS).
